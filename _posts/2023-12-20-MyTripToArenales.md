# Arenales
![Welcome to Arenales](/_posts/images/arenales/welcome.jpg "Wecolme to Arenales")
Bienvenidos, this post is intended to:
- Tell you about my first trad climbing trip as a "Leader".
- Get back to the community from which I've taken much and not given anything. This means trying to provide as much info as I can about the climbing routes I did with my good friends.
- Try to reference the good resources I've used to prepare myself for this trip.

Ah yes, this post ~~may be~~ is long, and it's a mixture of story telling and "technical climbing info", so skip to whichever part you like.

## Forewords
As stated on my homepage, this website can have posts either in Argentine Spanish or broken English. In this case, I've chosen the latter.

This is because, I am _really_ trying to get back to the worldwide community (how thoughtful Manu) and writting in English is probably the best way reaching the most amount of people. That being said, I am also writting in English because I simply want to (yes, you may call me _cipayo_).

It should be reminded, that I am, under no circumstances, a qualified climbing instructor and this should not be taken as a guide. This is simply the story of a gumby who was able to share a beautiful trip with his friends.

If you want to head right into the Climbing Info, just skip the Backstory or whatever you see fit. I am including plenty of pictures.

## Backstory
I started climbing on 2017 at one of those "ring the bell at the top" type of walls and it was more than enough to have me instantly hooked. From there, I started consistently climbing at the gym and at the ocassional crag.

Soon after I started, I met one of my biggest climbing friends, Santi. Santi is also a mountain guide who, over the course of our climbing partnership, took me to several amazing climbing destinations, such as Sierra La Vigilancia, Capilla del Monte, Piedra Parada, and many more.

However, one of them stood out, Arenales, located at the Mendoza's Cordillera, a.k.a., the Andes. My first trip to this place had me realise I hadn't actually experienced the beauty of climbing yet. 

These trips had me in awe, not only because of the stunning views and quality of the climbing, but also because of the sheer determination and composure that Santi and other friends (Tortu) climbed with.

Having succesfully lead two 6a trad pitches on one of those last trips, I learned two things: Trad climbing was indeed hard and required a mental strengh that I doubted I could ever achieve on my own. But I also knew I wanted to lead and share the experience with other people. 

This third trip to Arenales is the manifestation of both lessons and the culmination of a gumby's personal growth. This is the story of how I became Edu's and Juancho's Santi.

## Getting There, Gear & Other Resources
I will try not to make this section too long since, A, I don't really remember much (it was a long process) and B there are a million other places where you can find better Trad Climbing resources.

Let me say, that the single most valuable piece of advice I can give you about Arenales is: **get the guide**. You can, _sometimes_, buy it on climbing stores in Argentina or (I don't frankly know exactly how) you can get a PDF from the writter Nacho Elorza. For the second alternative, your best shot is to contact him on his instagram @arenalesclimbing.

To support the guide, I will only share the topos  of the two multi-pitches we did on this last trip Arenales.

### Getting There & Supermarket Haul
On all of my previous visits, we drove from Buenos Aires, on a long - but not that long - 14 hour drive to Arenales itself. This is probably the best way of getting there since you have no weight limits and get to buy most of your goodies beforehand. Also, the last leg of the trip from Manzano Historico to the valley has no public transportation.

However, we wanted to maximize the amount of time at the valley (driving takes 2 days of your trip) and minimize the travel fatigue (I wanted any little edge I could get to lead this trip). So, we took a 2-hour flight from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, and then picked up rented a car at the airport (previously hired over the internet, which ended up being 3x more expensive than the listed price so, don't use rentalcars.com).

From the airport, we headed to the supermarket and got our goodies for the trip. Now, back home I can name who the MVP's of the haul turned out to be:
- Peanut butter & Oreos
- Salame and Hard Cheese
- Pan Dulce (Argentine Pannetonne)
- Pistaccios

And the clear missess:
- A pound of mozzarella cheese
- Three pounds of assorted nuts, which were mostly consumed by the mice at the hut
- A box of Earl Grey tea bags
- More than 30 granola bars
- A huge potato

Back to the "getting there" part, we drove roughly two hours from Mendoza to Manzano Historico where we spent the night. 

Why not head up the Valley that same night?

Arenales is close the Argentine-Chilean border, so there is a military checkpoint that requires registration of anyone who wants to go up the mountains. This base operates from 8:00 AM to, as describe by one of the Genderames (Argentine Militar Forces), "prudent hours". I can confidently say that proudent hours are between 7 and 7:30 PM. 

**So basically you can only head up from 8 AM to 7:30 PM.**

### Gear
I will skip obvious personal gear such as helmet, absailing device, etc. Collectively as a group we had:

- Double Ropes (thanks Santi)
- 2 sets of 0.5 to 3 Camalots (one from Black Diamond and one from Wild Country)
- 2 Blue Aliens and 2 Green Aliens
- 1 Set of Black Diamond Nuts
- 8 Alpine Draws
- 6 Quickdraws
- 3 120cm Dyneema Slings
- 1 240cm Dyneema Sling
- 7m long 7mm Cordelette
- 10m long 6mm cord
- As many locking carabiners as we had (about 12)

In terms of clothing (this was December), what I used almost every single day was:
- Synthetic Hiking Pants
- Synthetic Long-Sleeved Baselayer
- Mid-layer from Target
- A baklava
- A puffy jacket
- Rain Jacket
- Big Puffy Jacket
- Camp Sandals (pair of Tevas)
- Sun Screen, lots of it (not clothing but putting it here feels right)

Again, this is just orientative for anybody kind of wondering what to bring but, as you can obviously tell, it is not a very extensive list.
