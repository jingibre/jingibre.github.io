Hey folks, this post is intended to:
- Tell you about my first trad climbing trip as a "Leader"
- Get back to the community from which I've taken much and not given anything. This means trying to provide as much info as I can about the climbing routes I did with my good friends.
- Try to reference the good resources I've used to prepare myself for this trip.
