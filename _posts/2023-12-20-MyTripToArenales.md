# Welcome
![Welcome to Arenales](/post_images/arenales/welcome.jpg "Welcome to Arenales")

Bienvenidos, this post is intended to:
- Tell you about my first trad climbing trip as a "Leader".
- Get back to the community from which I've taken much and not given anything. This means trying to provide as much info as I can about the climbing routes I did with my good friends.
- Try to reference the good resources I've used to prepare myself for this trip.

Ah yes, this post ~~may be~~ is long, and it's a mixture of story telling and "technical climbing info", so skip to whichever part you like.

BTW, I made a fairly long video of this trip, in case you want to see it.

## Forewords
As stated on my homepage, this website can have posts either in Argentine Spanish or broken English. In this case, I've chosen the latter.

This is because, I am _really_ trying to get back to the worldwide community (how thoughtful Manu) and writting in English is probably the best way reaching the most amount of people. That being said, I am also writting in English because I simply want to (yes, you may call me _cipayo_).

It should be reminded, that I am, under no circumstances, a qualified climbing instructor and this should not be taken as a guide. This is simply the story of a gumby who was able to share a beautiful trip with his friends.

If you want to head right into the Climbing Info, just skip the Backstory or whatever you see fit. I am including plenty of pictures.

## Backstory

I started climbing on 2017 at one of those "ring the bell at the top" type of walls and it was more than enough to have me instantly hooked. From there, I started consistently climbing at the gym and at the occasional crag.

Soon after I started, I met one of my biggest climbing friends, Santi. Santi is also a mountain guide who, over the course of our climbing partnership, took me to several amazing climbing destinations, such as Sierra La Vigilancia, Capilla del Monte, Piedra Parada, and many more.

However, one of them stood out, Arenales, located at the Mendoza's Cordillera, a.k.a., the Andes. My first trip to this place had me realise I hadn't actually experienced the beauty of climbing yet. 

These trips had me in awe, not only because of the stunning views and quality of the climbing, but also because of the sheer determination and composure that Santi and other friends (Tortu) climbed with.

_Santi, Tortu and Me on the summit of Patricia on my second trip to Arenales._


Having successfully lead two 6a trad pitches on one of those last trips, I learned two things: Trad climbing was indeed hard and required a mental strength that I doubted I could ever achieve on my own. But I also knew I wanted to lead and share the experience with other people.

Juancho and Edu are two of the most intelligent life forms I have met during my presence on this planet. Edu is essentially a real-life mad scientist (like the one from Flubber) and Juancho is a mystery box who never ceases to amaze me. I've met them while getting my bachelor's and
after discovering their interest towards climbing I immediately knew we had to make it to Arenales.

_Juancho and Edu posing for arguably one of their best pictures in Arenales._

This third trip to Arenales is the manifestation of the lessons learnt and the culmination of a gumby's personal growth. This is the story of how I became Edu's and Juancho's Santi.

## Getting There, Gear & Other Resources
I will try not to make this section too long since, A, I don't really remember much (it was a long process) and B there are a million other places where you can find better Trad Climbing resources.

Let me say, that the single most valuable piece of advice I can give you about Arenales is: **get the guide**. You can, _sometimes_, buy it on climbing stores in Argentina or (I don't frankly know exactly how) you can get a PDF from the writer Nacho Elorza. For the second alternative, your best shot is to contact him on his instagram @arenalesclimbing.

_The guide, picture by Naka Outdoors (located in Buenos Aires)._

To support the guide, I will only share personal ""topos"" of the two multi-pitches we did on this last trip to Arenales.

### Getting There & Supermarket Haul
On all of my previous visits, we drove from Buenos Aires, on a long - but not that long - 14 hour drive to Arenales itself. This is probably the best way of getting there since you have no weight limits and get to buy most of your goodies beforehand. Also, the last leg of the trip from Manzano Historico to the valley has no public transportation.

However, we wanted to maximize the amount of time at the valley (driving takes 2 days of your trip) and minimize the travel fatigue (I wanted any little edge I could get to lead this trip). So, we took a 2-hour flight from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, and then picked up rented a car at the airport (previously hired over the internet, which ended up being 3x more expensive than the listed price so, don't use rentalcars.com).

From the airport, we headed to the supermarket and got our goodies for the trip. Now, back home I can name who the MVP's of the haul turned out to be:
- Peanut butter & Oreos
- Salame and Hard Cheese
- Pan Dulce (Argentine Pannetonne)
- Pistachios
- Ingredients for a Putanesca sauce (anchovies, capers and olives) 

And the clear misses:
- A pound of mozzarella cheese
- Three pounds of assorted nuts, which were mostly consumed by the mice at the hut
- A box of Earl Grey tea bags
- More than 30 granola bars
- A huge potato

Back to the "getting there" part, we drove roughly two hours from Mendoza to Manzano Historico where we spent the night. 

Why not head up the Valley that same night?

Arenales is close the Argentine-Chilean border, so there is a military checkpoint that requires registration of anyone who wants to go up the mountains. This base operates from 8:00 AM to, as describe by one of the Gendarmes (Argentine Militar Forces), "prudent hours". I can confidently say that prudent hours are between 7 and 7:30 PM. 

**So basically you can only head up from 8 AM to 7:30 PM.**

### Gear
I will skip obvious personal gear such as helmet, abseiling device, etc. Collectively as a group we had:

- Double Ropes (thanks Santi)
- 2 sets of 0.5 to 3 Camalots (one from Black Diamond and one from Wild Country)
- 2 Blue Aliens and 2 Green Aliens
- 1 Set of Black Diamond Nuts
- 8 Alpine Draws
- 6 Quickdraws
- 3 120cm Dyneema Slings
- 1 240cm Dyneema Sling
- 7m long 7mm Cordelette
- 10m long 6mm cord
- As many locking carabiners as we had (about 12)
- 3 quick-links
- 1 Petzl Tibloc for self-rescue

In terms of clothing (this was December), what I used almost every single day was:
- Synthetic Hiking Pants
- Synthetic Long-Sleeved Baselayer
- Mid-layer from Target
- A baklava
- A puffy jacket
- Rain Jacket
- Big Puffy Jacket
- Camp Sandals (pair of Tevas)
- Sun Screen, lots of it (not clothing but putting it here feels right)

![](/post_images/arenales/packing_gear.jpg)
_Stuff I took Arenales this time, it did fit._

Again, this is just a guideline for anybody kind of wondering what to bring but, as you can obviously tell, it is not a very extensive description.

### Resources
I will try to list the most useful resources we used along the way to prepare for this trip.

#### Books
Besides trips with friends, I never had any formal Trad-specific climbing education, but I did read and used these which have proven to be more than enough for me.

## Day 1: Mujeres, Tequilas y Otras Hierbas
After a quick breakfast at Manzano Historico, we headed up the valley, arriving at the military checkpoint around 8 AM. From there we got to "El Puente" (the bridge) where we left our rented car (Toyota Etios that handled the gravel road just fine) at the parking spot.

![](/post_images/arenales/the_hut.jpg)
_The mountain hut at the valley._

The camping spot and mountain hut are located 20 minutes away from the car. When loaded with all the food and equipment, it can be quite a strenuous hike. Therefore, we decided to head straight to the Aguja Nuez (remember I needed any little edge I could get.) and then return for things to setup camp.

Finally, at 9 AM we started our approach to a classic multi-pitch _Mujeres, Tequilas y otras Hierbas_ graded 5+ and recommended in the guide.

Phew, that was quite long intro before actually talking climbing, sorry (or not hehe). Anyway, let's get to it.

### Approach
The approach involves hiking in steep scree towards the right of the Aguja Nuez, which can be easily spotted by the huge stone pillar called "La Proa". 

Arenales has the characteristic of having a million ways of reaching a given route. In this case, we probably took the worst, where scree accompanied us most of the way up.

![](/post_images/arenales/me_and_juancho_valley.jpg)
_That's Juancho and Me, stopping for the 10th time to catch our breath during the approach._

Once at the base of the route (1 long hour later), a 3rd class scramble will bring you to a huge plateau where Mujeres y Tequilas starts and many other routes as well (Black Titer Dyke).

### The Route
The route is a 5+ FR, 3 pitches route that is recommended in the guidebook. It is regarded as an iconic initiatory climb since all anchors have bolts and you can retreat at any point. Furthermore, the line follows a very clear diagonal flake that makes it impossible to get lost.

![](/post_images/arenales/scramble_to_mujeres_y_tequilas.jpg)
_The route and the "Topo". Yeah... get the guidebook."_

So there I was, at 10:30 AM on my first ever multi-pitch as a leader. I will admit that I had to gaslight myself into believing I liked this sport. 

#### Pitch 1: 4+
This pitch involves climbing a pretty blocky section with a style that we, as a group, denominated "Trepin-danger" which translates to something like Sketchy-Scrambling. This is the type of easy climbing between ledges where falling can lead into a broken ankle.

It is graded as a 4+ but I felt that the crux was around 5/5+. This discrepancy could be because, I was certainly very nervous and probably didn't choose the easiest path.

At the top you reach, yet again, another huge ledge that will feel like a deja-vu (bolted boulder).

#### Pitch 2: 5
This is arguably felt the easiest of all the pitches that day. This is a very straight forward pitch that follows the flake edge. The rock quality is amazing and protections are abundant.

At this point, I was feeling really comfortable and confident, which was a great thing. I even found myself singing while climbing.

This pitch ends at a not so comfortable standing belay on a sort of a small cave.

#### Pitch 3: 5+
A really fun 5+ pitch that involves easy lay-backing combined with steming at the beginning. The crux of the route is located at the very beginning by exiting the cave (it is not a roof though). This route had plenty of good hand-jams that made it really fun.

The pitch ends at a pretty comfortable sitting belay from the top of the Aguja Nuez pillar, the views from here are just amazing.

![](/post_images/arenales/edu_juancho_muj_y_teq.jpg)
_Juancho and Edu killing it on arguably the best pitch of the climb._

From this point on, you may choose to rappel down the 3 pitches and call it a day. However, we felt pretty good and decided to do the an extension suggested in the guide and by some people.

#### Extension Pitch 4: 5 or 6a
From this point you have two options for doing an extension. One is a 6a crack system that looked pretty daunting from the bottom. This one lies on the facewall in front of the anchors and will definitely try next time.

The second option is an easy blocky 4+ to 5 grade climb around the facewall. I chose this path since it was literally my first time leading a group and I opted for the safest option. 

![](/post_images/arenales/extension_muj_teq.jpg)
_Extension pitch - the easy option. On the right you can see the system of cracks that seemed pretty daunting from the bottom._ 

According to the guidebook, this extension pitch (whichever option you choose) ends at a removable anchor located at a huge ledge. However, I somehow landed at a fixed anchor, which the guidebook did not show nor mentioned. 

![](/post_images/arenales/traverse.jpg)
_The boys doing the actual last pitch of the day, a 3rd class traverse with beautiful views._

So, there I was, essentially lost (albeit on a huge comfortable ledge) but I knew we were not that far from where I should have ended. After bringing my partners up, we were able to lean over the ledge we were standing and successfully spotted the ledge (which had the start of our abseils down). 

After some brainstorming sesh with the guys, I started the actual last pitch of our endeavour which consisted of a 3rd-4th traverse to the anchors with a subtle downclimb. 

![](/post_images/arenales/actual_exteions_muj.jpg)
_Top view of the extension (in Spanish and not great either)_

### Getting Down
As mentioned before, you may descent from the same route or do the extension and abseil through Black Titer Dyke. The latter -and the one we chose- has the advantage of being quite vertical, lessening the chances of getting the ropes stuck.

![](/post_images/arenales/us_rapelling_2.jpg)
_Rapping down Black Titer Dyke._

These rappels end at big ledge that requires an easy downclimb to get to the start of Mujeres y Tequilas.

I loved this route, if I had to pick a word to describe it I would say, safe. It gave me the confidence to lead my first multi-pitch in harmony.

## Day 2: Chilling and Single Pitches at Carlos Daniel
We felt surprisingly good the day after our first multi-pitch and thought of doing some sort of active rest. We chose the single-pitches at Carlos Daniel since it featured some easy trad routes that Juancho and Edu could try leading.

![](/post_images/arenales/edu_climbing_zafarranchp.png)
_Edu onsighting his first trad route._

And they not only tried but also onsighted their first trad pitch (a not so blocky 4th class). Edu displayed a repose that I had not seen in him before , and Juancho showed his inner survival mode that not many have privilege of witnessing. 

![](/post_images/arenales/me_on_the_flake.png)
_Me on the start of The Flake, things got spicy at the traverse._

On my end, I got on a 6a called "the Flake" which I had tried on previous trips. I was never able to redpoint it but with my newly gained confidence I thought I would ace it. Syke! I was terrorized by a traverse that I blindly protected with a sketchy #2 and had to pick my mental from the depths of the earth to complete the route.

After a soft dinner at the hut, we chatted about the next day activities. Initially, our plan was to head to Patricia (6a) but after that traumatizing pitch I wasn't confident enough anymore to lead several 6a routes (I wasn't confident enough to lead anything actually, more on that coming). 

Finally, after several recommendations from some new friends from La Plata, we settled on El Zorro (5+). The route sounded pretty good on paper but it didn't have a single bolted anchor and, that, worried me deeply.

That night I got into the tent carrying plenty of anxiety but I thought it was just the shock from The Flake and that it would all go away once I counted my sheep. 

Syke again! I had literally one of my worst nights at the mountains where I am pretty sure I endured my first panic attack. I was chaperoned by an inner Gollum whose personal mission was to demolish any confidence I had in me towards climbing (and life in general lol). When I finally decided to confront this new buddy of mine and zip him for a bit, the alarm went off.  

## Day 3: El Zorro
We got up as early as we could (I was already up chatting with my inner Gollum) to have spare time in case we got lost or had any type of setback. A quick breakfast and we were off to our final multi-pitch of the trip.

_Sorry, I lied, no topo of this one since, no pictures._

### Approach
A typical Arenales approach with steep hike over scree. However, I will say that this one felt significantly easier than Mujeres y Tequilas. The start of the route is to the left of the Jesus Christ statue so it's pretty hard to miss.

![](/post_images/arenales/start_zorro.jpg)
_Start of El Zorro, the picture is not mine but, shh, nobody has to know._

### The Route
The route is another beginner friendly multi-pitch located at the Aguja Cara del Inca. It was described by one of the guys from La Plata as "the easies route on the valley". The guidebook also recommends this line due to its great last pitch which I will describe later.

#### Pitch 1: 5
The pitch starts at the left side of the Jesus Christ easily spotted by some kind of chimney combined with a dihedral. 

This pitch had me pretty nervous at the start but I must say it was really fun, and once the crux was over (the first meters), it became a pretty mellow blocky journey to the top.

![](/post_images/arenales/edu_juancho_zorro.jpg)
_Juancho belaying Edu in the first pitch._

The anchor is located at a system of ledges where and protruding boulder becomes the obvious choice. Once I saw it, my climbing confidence was almost restored to its fullest.

![](/post_images/arenales/anchor_1.jpg)
_Pitch 1 Anchor._


#### Pitch 2: 5+
![](/post_images/arenales/pitch_2.png)
_View of Pitch 2 from the bottom._

Can't remember much about this pitch but it involved some easy blocky climbing with one or two 5+ moves. At this point, my inner Gollum was being real quiet and I was really enjoying the experience.

![](/post_images/arenales/juancho_and_me.jpg)
_Me and Juancho discussing... something?_

This pitch ends at another system of ledges with plenty of vertical cracks to create an anchor with bomber gear. Three cams and a coordellete took care of matter.

![](/post_images/arenales/anchor_2.jpg)
_Pitch 2 Anchor._

#### Pitch 3: 5+/6a
This pitch starts off with a hand sized crack near a dihedral that allows for some stemming to escape the net-crack-climbing. The pitch finishes at another ledge system with, _yet again_, more vertical cracks for a bomber anchors. Three more cams and a 240 cm sling slayed the matter.

![](/post_images/arenales/anchor_3.jpg)
_Pitch 3 Anchor._

#### Pitch 4: 6a
Another blocky pitch that, as I began climbing, thought would be a Trepin-Danger (Sketchy Scrambling) but it involved some traversing together with some 6a moves. The crux was at the top and I was using my gear sparingly sine I didn't know what I would need at the anchor. Luckily after a delicate move with a great hand jam I reached the top, a huge boulder that the cordellete handled really well.

![](/post_images/arenales/anchor_4.png)
_Huge boulder at Pitch 4 Anchor._

#### Pitch 5: 5+ The GOAT
This pitch follows two cracks located at the headwall infront of the boulder. The start involves an exposed move (but easy & fun) where you need to downclimb a little, turn around and lean from the anchor ledge into the headwall hands first (there is a gap between both formations). 

Before doing it, Gollum was speaking back to me but I told him to shut it and proceeded to lean towards the wall with as much confidence I could gather. Once I grabbed the first hold I knew I was in for a sweet ride. 

![](/post_images/arenales/me_on_el_zorro.jpg)
_Me crushing it on the last pitch of El Zorro 5+._

With a bomber #1 in, I was ready to enjoy what perhaps is, the best 5+ I've done in my entire life (as a gumby). The system of cracks were perfect, offering the possibility of net-crack-climbing if desired. 

![](/post_images/arenales/perspective_zorro.jpg)
_Edu and Juancho from the top of the last pitch._

The pitch ends right at the top of the headwall where a small boulder can be slinged into an anchor (with a counter-pull cam as a backup).

![](/post_images/arenales/juancho_zorro.JPG)
_Juancho coming up the last pitch, the view was stunning (I was too anxious to appreciate it)._

### Getting Down
The great part of this route is that no abseilling is required (walk-off). It starts by walking towards the back of the route and then descending a steep scree hike, it is important to stay towards the right of the descent. Once the path ends, a short 3rd-4th downclimb will leave you at the huge canal which ends at the Jesus statue.

![](/post_images/arenales/down_el_zorro.jpg)
_Top view of the walk-off drawn by me (sorry). Bottom would be the front of the facewall._

Once we got down, I was finally able to enjoy our accomplishment and savour the beautiful day we had at the mountains. After a terrible night with myself I was able to prove me wrong and accept my capabilities. Yeah, fuck you inner Gollum.

![](/post_images/arenales/us_at_the_base.jpg)
_Us, safe and sound, at the base of the route. Do I have a white spot?_

### Day 4: Rest Day
After a celebratory meal the night before (I could finally eat without stress), we took our final day off at the valley. Not much happened in terms of climbing but we did a pretty cool hike to the top of the "plug" where some astonishing views of the valley took protagonism. 

![](/post_images/arenales/mate_spot.jpg)
_The mate spot after crossing the first plug of rocks in the valley._

We also got to enjoy probably the best (a lot of best and worsts in this trip) mate I had in the mountains while listening to some good music alongside Juancho and Edu.

I do recommend hiking up since it offers a good way of resting your fingers and also provides some really good views of the cordillera without too much effort.

## Ending Words
Arenales still doesn't cease to amaze me, with the only real downside being the existential crisis that I'm left with when back at home.

Arenales has consistently provided me:

- Amazing climbing
- Mental battles
- Great friends
- Appreciation of simple foods
- Justification for bath evasion

For these, I am grateful and eager to request them again next year. However, I want to single out one thing I am really grateful for: Juancho and Edu. Without them, this trip could have never happened. Not just because I needed partners but because they believed in me.

I'll leave you with a quote that resonated with me when writing this post and that I hope resonates with you as well:

> “You get to the top of a wall, there’s nothing up there. Lionel Terray, the great French climber called it ‘The conquistadors of the useless.’ Yeah, the end result is absolutely useless, but every time I travel, I learn something new and hopefully I get to be a better person.” – Yvon Chouinard, 180 Degrees South

See you on the next post, or not (I understand, this was too long and maybe boring).
